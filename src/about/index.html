            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I see modern challenges as a puzzle that I can use my technical skills and creative vision to solve. I am continuously looking to expand my expertise to expand my repertoire of skills and techniques to remain on the cutting edge of the technology industry, to adapt my vision as the problems, tools, and technologies evolve. </p>

                <p>From a young age, I have enjoyed learning about new technologies, often toying with them until I learned the ins and outs of them. I vividly remember pressing every button on a cassette tape player during Sunday School as a 5-year-old. This love for finding how things work continued as I was exposed to newer technologies around my house. When my parents and older relatives bought smartphones and tablets, I dove in headfirst trying to help them understand how their devices worked even though I did not have one of my own. My desire to understand new technologies continued into high school when I spent my time outside of the classroom focusing on learning technical skills within photography on my own. I took these skills and put them into practice by shooting sports for my school. The opportunity to use technology to creatively problem solve motivated me to keep learning and growing my skills.</p> 
                
                <p>While completing my course studies in Cyber Security, Iâ€™ve begun to focus time outside of the classroom learning about Web Application Development and Cloud security. Iâ€™m driven to learn how new technologies will shape the world landscape in years to come. Building practical experience outside of the classroom through competitive events and personal projects keeps my skills sharp. </p>
